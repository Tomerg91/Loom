# Step 7: Coach Resource Library Management Page - Completion Report

## Overview

This document summarizes the completion of **Step 7: Create Coach Resource Library Management Page** from the DATABASE_REFACTORING_PLAN.md Phase 3.

**Objective**: Implement a complete resource library management UI for coaches, integrating upload, organization, sharing, and analytics features.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Main Resource Library Page

**File**: `src/app/[locale]/coach/resources/page.tsx`

- **Route**: `/[locale]/coach/resources`
- **Access Control**: Coach-only via `<CoachRoute>` guard
- **Features**:
  - Suspense boundary with loading state
  - Server-side dynamic rendering
  - Coach role verification

**File**: `src/components/resources/resource-library-page.tsx`

Main orchestrator component that integrates all resource library functionality:

**State Management**:
- React Query for server state (resources, collections, analytics)
- Local state for dialogs and filters
- Optimistic updates with cache invalidation

**Tab Navigation**:
1. **All Resources** - Resource grid with filtering
2. **Collections** - Collection management
3. **Analytics** - Analytics dashboard and insights

**Dialog Management**:
- Upload dialog (create resources)
- Collection dialog (create/edit collections)
- Share dialog (share resources with clients)

**Mutation Handlers**:
- Delete resources with confirmation
- Delete collections with confirmation
- Success/error toast notifications
- Automatic cache invalidation

### 2. API Endpoints

#### Resources API

**`src/app/api/coach/resources/route.ts`**
- `GET /api/coach/resources` - List resources with filtering
  - Query params: category, tags, search, sortBy, sortOrder
  - Returns: Array of ResourceLibraryItem
  - Auth: Coach only
  - Uses: `getCoachLibraryResources()` from database layer

**`src/app/api/coach/resources/[id]/route.ts`**
- `DELETE /api/coach/resources/[id]` - Delete resource
  - Auth: Coach only, ownership verified
  - Soft delete with RLS policy enforcement

**`src/app/api/coach/resources/analytics/route.ts`**
- `GET /api/coach/resources/analytics` - Get library analytics
  - Returns: LibraryAnalytics
  - Auth: Coach only
  - Uses: `getLibraryAnalytics()` from database layer

#### Collections API

**`src/app/api/coach/collections/route.ts`**
- `GET /api/coach/collections` - List all collections
  - Returns: Array of ResourceCollection with item counts
  - Auth: Coach only
  - Uses: `getCoachCollections()` from database layer

- `POST /api/coach/collections` - Create collection
  - Body: { name, description?, icon? }
  - Returns: Created ResourceCollection
  - Auth: Coach only
  - Uses: `createCollection()` from database layer

**`src/app/api/coach/collections/[id]/route.ts`**
- `DELETE /api/coach/collections/[id]` - Delete collection
  - Auth: Coach only, ownership verified
  - Note: Resources remain, only collection deleted

- `PATCH /api/coach/collections/[id]` - Update collection
  - Body: { name?, description?, icon? }
  - Returns: Updated ResourceCollection
  - Auth: Coach only, ownership verified

### 3. Component Integration

All existing resource components are integrated seamlessly:

**Upload Workflow**:
- `<ResourceUploadDialog>` - File upload with drag & drop
- Form validation (category, tags, description)
- Collection assignment during upload
- Progress tracking
- Success callback triggers cache refresh

**Collection Management**:
- `<CollectionDialog>` - Create/edit collections
- `<CollectionCard>` - Display collection with item count
- Edit/delete actions
- Icon/emoji support

**Resource Display**:
- `<ResourceGrid>` - Grid layout for resources
- `<ResourceCard>` - Individual resource card
- `<ResourceFilters>` - Category, tags, search filtering
- `<ResourceEmptyState>` - Empty state with CTA

**Sharing Workflow**:
- `<ResourceShareDialog>` - Share with clients
- Bulk share (all clients)
- Individual client selection
- Permission levels (view, download)
- Expiration dates

**Analytics**:
- `<AnalyticsOverview>` - High-level metrics dashboard
  - Total resources
  - Total views
  - Total downloads
  - Total completions
  - Engagement rate

- `<TopResourcesList>` - Most viewed resources
- `<AutoShareSettings>` - Auto-share preferences

### 5. Data Flow

```
User Action → Component Handler → API Endpoint → Database Function → Response
     ↓
  Cache Invalidation
     ↓
  UI Refresh (React Query)
     ↓
  Toast Notification
```

**Example: Upload Resource**
1. User selects file in `<ResourceUploadDialog>`
2. Form submission triggers `handleUploadSuccess()`
3. POST request to upload API (not implemented in this step - uses existing upload system)
4. On success:
   - Close dialog
   - Invalidate `['coach-resources']` query
   - Invalidate `['coach-library-analytics']` query
   - Show success toast
5. React Query automatically refetches data
6. UI updates with new resource

**Example: Delete Resource**
1. User clicks delete on `<ResourceCard>`
2. Confirmation dialog shown
3. DELETE request to `/api/coach/resources/[id]`
4. RLS policy verifies ownership
5. On success:
   - Invalidate queries
   - Show success toast
   - Resource removed from UI

### 6. Security Considerations

**Authentication & Authorization**:
- All API endpoints verify authentication
- Coach role verification before any operations
- RLS policies enforce data access at database level

**Ownership Verification**:
- Resources: `user_id = coach.id AND is_library_resource = true`
- Collections: `coach_id = coach.id`
- Shares: Only coach can share their own resources

**Input Validation**:
- Zod schemas in components
- Server-side validation in API routes
- File type/size validation in upload dialog

**Error Handling**:
- Try-catch blocks in all API routes
- User-friendly error messages
- Console logging for debugging
- Toast notifications for user feedback

  const data = await response.json();

  expect(data.success).toBe(true);
  expect(Array.isArray(data.data)).toBe(true);
  // Verify filtering and sorting applied
});

// Example: Test collection creation
it('should create a new collection', async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/coach/collections', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      name: 'Test Collection',
      description: 'Test description',
    }),
  });
  const data = await response.json();

  expect(data.success).toBe(true);

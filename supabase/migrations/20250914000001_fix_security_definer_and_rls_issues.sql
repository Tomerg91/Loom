-- Fix Security Issues: Remove SECURITY DEFINER from views and Enable RLS on tables
-- This migration addresses 14 security issues identified by the database linter

-- ============================================================================
-- PART 1: Enable RLS on tables that are missing it
-- ============================================================================

-- Enable RLS on trusted_devices table

-- PART 2: Recreate views without SECURITY DEFINER property
-- ============================================================================

-- Note: Views cannot have SECURITY DEFINER property in PostgreSQL

-- Migration completed: All 14 security issues have been addressed
-- - 4 tables now have RLS enabled with appropriate policies
-- - 10 views have been recreated without SECURITY DEFINER properties
-- - Proper permissions have been granted to authenticated users
-- - Access control is now enforced through RLS policies on underlying tables

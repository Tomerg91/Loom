# Loom App: Roadmap to Production

**Last Updated:** August 8, 2025

## 1. Project Status Overview

This document outlines the necessary steps to bring the Loom app to a production-ready state for paying users. While the application has a strong architectural foundation, several critical issues must be resolved before deployment.

**Current State:** Pre-Production (Not Ready for Paying Users)

**Key Strengths:**
*   Modern Tech Stack (Next.js, React, TypeScript, Supabase)
*   Solid CI/CD Pipeline
*   Good Code Quality and Project Structure

**Critical Weaknesses:**
*   **P0 Security Vulnerabilities:** Multiple critical security holes that expose the app and its users to significant risks.
*   **Incomplete Core Functionality:** Key features for clients, coaches, and admins are missing or broken.
*   **Data Integrity Issues:** Use of mock and hardcoded data in essential parts of the application.

---

## 2. Deployment Readiness Roadmap

This roadmap is divided into four phases, with an estimated **60-80 hours** of development work.

*   **Phase 1: Security Hardening (P0)**
    *   Fix all critical security vulnerabilities.
    *   Resolve all TypeScript errors to enable security scanning.
*   **Phase 2: Core Functionality Implementation (P0)**
    *   Complete the client, coach, and admin dashboards.
    *   Implement the missing session management and file upload features.
*   **Phase 3: Polishing and Optimization (P1-P2)**
    *   Refine the notifications system and internationalization.
    *   Optimize application performance.
*   **Phase 4: Pre-Launch & Deployment**
    *   Conduct a full security audit and regression testing.
    *   Deploy to production.

## 3. Critical P0 Issues (Production Blockers)

These issues **must be fixed** before the application can be considered for production deployment.

### 3.1. Security Vulnerabilities

| ID  | Vulnerability                  | File(s)                                       | Description                                                              |
| --- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| S1  | MFA Service Security Backdoor  | `src/lib/services/mfa-service.ts`             | Hardcoded test data allows MFA bypass.                                   |
| S2  | API Rate Limiting Gaps         | `src/app/api/sessions/route.ts`, `.../users/route.ts` | Missing rate limiting on critical endpoints, enabling brute-force attacks. |
| S3  | CORS Wildcard Misconfiguration | Multiple API endpoints, `nginx.conf`          | `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` allows cross-origin attacks.            |
| S4  | Client-Side Auth Exposure      | `src/lib/auth/auth-context.tsx`               | Sensitive MFA and session data exposed on the client-side.               |

### 3.2. Core Functionality Gaps

| ID  | Feature Area        | File(s)                                     | Description                                                                                             |
| --- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| F1  | Client Dashboard    | `src/components/client/client-dashboard.tsx`  | "Coming soon" placeholders for reflections, mock data for mood/goals, and broken session navigation.    |
| F2  | Coach Dashboard     | `src/components/coach/coach-dashboard.tsx`    | "Coming soon" for client management, hardcoded revenue data, and no client management tools.            |
| F3  | Admin Dashboard     | `src/lib/database/admin-analytics.ts`         | Broken analytics due to non-existent tables, hardcoded values, and missing data export functionality. |

## 4. High-Priority P1 Issues

These issues represent significant gaps in the application's functionality and architecture.

| ID  | Issue                          | File(s)                                                                                             | Description                                                                                             |

| F4  | File Upload & Sharing System   | `src/lib/services/file-service.ts`                                                                  | Core file upload and sharing functionality is missing; only a mock service exists.                      |
| T1  | TypeScript Compilation Errors  | Multiple files                                                                                      | Over 190 TypeScript errors are preventing security analysis tools from running.                         |

## 5. Medium-Priority P2 Polish Items

These items are important for user experience and performance but are not immediate blockers.

| ID  | Issue                       | File(s)                                         | Description                                                                                             |
| --- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| UX1 | Notifications System Polish | `src/components/notifications/notification-center.tsx` | Notification clicks are not functional, settings are not connected, and real-time updates are missing. |
| UX2 | Internationalization        | `src/i18n/routing.ts`                           | The default language needs to be set to Hebrew, and RTL layouts need verification.                      |
| P1  | Performance Optimizations   | Dashboard components, API responses             | Lack of API response caching and component memoization is impacting performance.                       |

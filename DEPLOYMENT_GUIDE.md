## Staging Deployment

### Step 1: Push Feature Branch

```bash
cd /Users/tomergalansky/Desktop/loom-app/.worktrees/feature-tasks-module

# Ensure all changes committed
git status

# Push feature branch to remote
git push origin feature-tasks-module
```

### Step 2: Apply Database Migration to Staging

**Option A: Via Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)**

1. Log into Supabase Dashboard
2. Select **Staging Project**
3. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
4. Open migration file: `supabase/migrations/20251025000000_add_tasks_domain.sql`
5. Copy entire contents
6. Paste into SQL Editor
7. Click **Run**
8. Verify success message

**Option B: Via Supabase CLI**

```bash
cd /Users/tomergalansky/Desktop/loom-app/.worktrees/feature-tasks-module

# Link to staging project
supabase link --project-ref <staging-project-ref>

# Apply migrations
supabase db push

# Verify migration applied
supabase db diff
# Should show no differences
```

### Step 3: Verify Database Migration

Run verification queries in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- 1. Verify tables exist
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
AND table_name IN ('task_categories', 'tasks', 'task_instances', 'task_progress_updates');
-- Expected: 4 rows

-- 2. Verify indexes exist
SELECT indexname
FROM pg_indexes
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
AND indexname LIKE 'idx_task%';
-- Expected: 5 rows

-- 3. Verify RLS enabled
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
AND tablename IN ('task_categories', 'tasks', 'task_instances', 'task_progress_updates');
-- Expected: 4 rows, all with rowsecurity = true

-- 4. Verify foreign keys
SELECT
  tc.table_name,
  kcu.column_name,
  ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name,
  ccu.column_name AS foreign_column_name
FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc
JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
  ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
  ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY'
AND tc.table_name IN ('task_categories', 'tasks', 'task_instances', 'task_progress_updates');
-- Expected: 5 foreign key relationships
```

### Step 4: Deploy Application to Staging

**If using Vercel:**

```bash
# Vercel will auto-deploy when branch is pushed
# Or trigger manually:
vercel --prod --scope=<your-team>
```

**If using other platform:**

Follow your platform's deployment procedure for the staging environment.

### Step 5: Run Smoke Tests on Staging

1. **Health Check**
   ```bash
   curl https://staging.loom-app.com/api/health
   # Expected: 200 OK
   ```

2. **API Endpoints**
   - Test GET /api/tasks (as coach)
   - Test POST /api/tasks (create task)
   - Test GET /api/client/tasks (as client)

3. **UI Verification**
   - Navigate to https://staging.loom-app.com/coach/tasks
   - Verify page loads without errors
   - Navigate to https://staging.loom-app.com/client/tasks
   - Verify page loads without errors

4. **Quick Functional Test**
   - Login as coach
   - Create a task
   - Assign to a client
   - Login as client
   - Verify task appears
   - Add progress update
   - Login as coach
   - Verify progress visible

### Step 6: Monitor Staging

Monitor for 24-48 hours:

- [ ] Check Sentry for errors
- [ ] Check Supabase logs for RLS violations
- [ ] Monitor API response times
- [ ] Gather feedback from internal testers

### Step 7: Complete Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Assign QA team to complete `MANUAL_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md`
- [ ] Document all bugs found
- [ ] Fix critical issues
- [ ] Re-deploy fixes to staging
- [ ] Re-test

---

## Production Deployment

**IMPORTANT:** Do not proceed to production until:
- [ ] All staging smoke tests passed
- [ ] Manual testing checklist completed and approved
- [ ] All critical bugs resolved
- [ ] Product team sign-off received

### Step 1: Create Pull Request

```bash
cd /Users/tomergalansky/Desktop/loom-app/.worktrees/feature-tasks-module

git fetch origin
git merge origin/main
# Resolve conflicts if any

# Push latest changes
git push origin feature-tasks-module

- **Time:** During low-traffic hours (e.g., 2-4 AM PST)
- **Avoid:** Weekends, holidays, or high-traffic periods

**Communication:**
1. Notify team in Slack #engineering channel:
   ```
   ðŸ“¢ Deployment Notice
   Feature: Tasks Module
   Scheduled: [Date] at [Time] PST
   Downtime: None expected
   Migration: Database schema changes (additive only, no data loss)
   Rollback plan: Available
   ```

2. Notify stakeholders:
   - Product team
   - Customer support team
   - QA team

### Step 4: Merge to Main

```bash
# Via GitHub UI
# Click "Merge Pull Request" â†’ "Confirm Merge"

# Or via command line (after PR approved):
cd /Users/tomergalansky/Desktop/loom-app
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge feature-tasks-module
git push origin main
```

### Step 5: Apply Database Migration to Production

**CRITICAL: Backup Database First**

```bash
# Via Supabase Dashboard:
# 1. Go to Database â†’ Backups
# 2. Click "Create Backup"
# 3. Wait for backup to complete
# 4. Verify backup exists before proceeding
```

**Apply Migration:**

```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor for PRODUCTION project

-- MIGRATION: 20251025000000_add_tasks_domain.sql
-- Copy and paste entire migration file here
-- Execute

-- VERIFY:
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
AND table_name IN ('task_categories', 'tasks', 'task_instances', 'task_progress_updates');
-- Expected: 4 rows
```

### Step 6: Deploy Application to Production

**If using Vercel:**

```bash
# Production deployment auto-triggers on main branch push
# Or trigger manually:
vercel --prod
```

**Monitor Deployment:**
1. Watch build logs
2. Verify build completes successfully
3. Verify deployment succeeds

### Step 7: Post-Deployment Verification

**Immediate Checks (within 5 minutes):**

1. **Health Check**
   ```bash
   curl https://loom-app.com/api/health
   # Expected: 200 OK
   ```

2. **Database Connection**
   ```bash
   curl https://loom-app.com/api/tasks
   # Expected: 401 Unauthorized (good - auth required)
   # Or 200 with empty data if authenticated
   ```

3. **Page Loads**
   - Navigate to https://loom-app.com/coach/tasks
   - Expected: Login prompt or tasks page (if logged in)
   - No 500 errors

4. **Sentry Check**
   - Open Sentry dashboard
   - Expected: No new errors
   - Filter by last 5 minutes

5. **Supabase Logs**
   - Check for RLS violations
   - Check for query errors
   - Expected: Normal traffic, no errors

**Full Verification (within 1 hour):**

1. **Functional Test**
   - Login as test coach account
   - Create a task
   - Assign to test client
   - Login as test client
   - Verify task visible
   - Add progress update
   - Verify no errors

2. **Performance Check**
   - Verify page load times < 2 seconds
   - Verify API response times < 500ms
   - Check database query performance

3. **Monitor Metrics**
   - Error rate (should be ~0%)
   - Response times (should be normal)
   - Database connections (should be stable)

### Step 8: Monitor Production (First 24 Hours)

**Hour 1:**
- [ ] Check Sentry every 15 minutes
- [ ] Monitor user activity logs
- [ ] Watch for error spikes

**Hour 2-4:**
- [ ] Check Sentry hourly
- [ ] Monitor database performance
- [ ] Review user feedback

**Hour 4-24:**
- [ ] Check Sentry every 4 hours
- [ ] Monitor key metrics
- [ ] Gather user feedback

**Monitoring Checklist:**
- [ ] No increase in error rate
- [ ] No performance degradation
- [ ] No RLS policy violations
- [ ] No user complaints
- [ ] Database queries performing well

### Step 9: Rollback Procedure (If Needed)

**When to Rollback:**
- Critical bugs affecting all users
- Data integrity issues
- Security vulnerabilities discovered
- Unacceptable performance degradation

**Rollback Steps:**

1. **Revert Code Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Via Vercel:
   # Go to Deployments â†’ Find previous stable deployment â†’ Click "Promote to Production"

   # Or via git:
   git revert <commit-hash>
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Rollback Database (Only if absolutely necessary)**
   ```sql
   -- CAUTION: This will delete all task data
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS task_progress_updates CASCADE;
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS task_instances CASCADE;
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS tasks CASCADE;
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS task_categories CASCADE;
   ```

   **Better Alternative:** Fix forward instead of rolling back database

3. **Restore from Backup (If data corruption occurred)**
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard â†’ Backups
   - Select pre-deployment backup
   - Click "Restore"
   - Verify data integrity

4. **Notify Team**
   ```
   ðŸš¨ Rollback Executed
   Feature: Tasks Module
   Reason: [describe issue]
   Status: Rolled back to previous version
   Next steps: [plan for fix]
   ```

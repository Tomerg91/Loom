# Loom App - Refactoring Plan

## 1. Codebase Overview

This document outlines a refactoring plan for the Loom App, a modern web application built with Next.js 15 and a comprehensive stack of technologies. The goal of this refactoring is to improve the codebase's maintainability, scalability, and performance while preserving full functionality.

### Key Technologies:

*   **Framework:** Next.js 15
*   **UI:** React 19, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS, `lucide-react`
*   **State Management:** Zustand, React Query
*   **Forms:** React Hook Form, Zod
*   **Backend & Database:** Supabase
*   **Testing:** Vitest, Playwright, React Testing Library
*   **Tooling:** ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript

## 2. Refactoring Goals

*   **Improve Code Modularity and Reusability:** Structure components and modules to be more self-contained and reusable across the application.
*   **Enhance State Management Consistency:** Establish clear patterns for using Zustand and React Query to manage global and server state.
*   **Optimize Performance:** Identify and address performance bottlenecks, particularly in data fetching, rendering, and asset loading.
*   **Strengthen Testing Strategy:** Improve test coverage and ensure a consistent and effective testing approach across different levels (unit, integration, e2e).
*   **Refine Developer Experience:** Streamline the development workflow and improve code consistency and readability.

## 3. Refactoring Areas

### 3.1. Component Architecture

*   **Atomic Design:** Implement an atomic design methodology for structuring components. This involves organizing components into `atoms`, `molecules`, `organisms`, `templates`, and `pages`. This will improve reusability and make the component library easier to manage.
    *   **`src/components/atoms`**: Basic UI elements like `Button`, `Input`, `Label`.
    *   **`src/components/molecules`**: Combinations of atoms, like a search form (`Input` + `Button`).
    *   **`src/components/organisms`**: More complex UI components, like a header or a sidebar.
    *   **`src/app/**/page.tsx`**: These will serve as the "pages".
*   **Component API Design:** Enforce consistent prop patterns and naming conventions for all components. Use TypeScript to define clear and strict component props.
*   **Barrel Exports:** Use `index.ts` files to export components from their respective directories, simplifying import statements.

### 3.2. State Management

*   **Zustand for Global UI State:** Use Zustand exclusively for managing global UI state that is not tied to server data (e.g., theme, mobile navigation state).
*   **React Query for Server State:** Use React Query for all data fetching, caching, and synchronization with the server. This includes features like automatic refetching, optimistic updates, and error handling.
*   **Custom Hooks for State Logic:** Encapsulate related state logic and actions into custom hooks to promote reusability and separation of concerns. For example, a `useAuth` hook could manage user authentication state.

### 3.3. Data Fetching & Caching

*   **Centralized API Layer:** Create a centralized API layer in `src/lib/api` to handle all communication with the Supabase backend. This will make it easier to manage API endpoints and handle errors consistently.
*   **React Query Keys:** Establish a consistent and predictable naming convention for React Query keys to avoid collisions and ensure efficient caching.
*   **Optimistic Updates:** Implement optimistic updates for mutations to improve the user experience.

### 3.4. Authentication & Authorization

*   **Consolidate Auth Logic:** Consolidate all authentication-related logic into a dedicated module, including Supabase client initialization, session management, and route protection.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** If applicable, implement a clear and scalable RBAC system to manage user permissions.

### 3.5. Styling and Theming

*   **Tailwind CSS Configuration:** Refine the Tailwind CSS configuration to remove unused styles and define a consistent design system (colors, spacing, typography).
*   **CSS-in-JS vs. Global Styles:** Establish clear guidelines on when to use CSS-in-JS (for component-specific styles) and when to use global styles.
*   **Theming with CSS Variables:** Use CSS variables for theming to allow for dynamic theme switching (e.g., light/dark mode).

### 3.6. Testing Strategy

*   **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for all individual components, hooks, and utility functions using Vitest and React Testing Library.
*   **Integration Tests:** Write integration tests to verify the interaction between different parts of the application.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Use Playwright to write E2E tests for critical user flows.
*   **Test Coverage:** Aim for a minimum of 80% test coverage across the codebase.

### 3.7. Performance Optimization

*   **Code Splitting:** Leverage Next.js's dynamic imports to code-split the application and only load the JavaScript needed for the current page.
*   **Image Optimization:** Use the Next.js Image component to automatically optimize images.
*   **Bundle Analysis:** Regularly analyze the bundle size using `webpack-bundle-analyzer` to identify large dependencies and opportunities for optimization.
*   **Lighthouse Audits:** Regularly run Lighthouse audits to identify and address performance issues.

### 3.8. Developer Experience

*   **Storybook:** Introduce Storybook for developing and documenting UI components in isolation.
*   **Linting and Formatting:** Enforce strict linting and formatting rules to maintain code consistency.
*   **Documentation:** Improve inline documentation and create a comprehensive `CONTRIBUTING.md` file to guide new developers.

## 4. Proposed Roadmap

1.  **Phase 1: Foundation & Tooling (1-2 weeks)**
    *   Set up Storybook.
    *   Refine ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript configurations.
    *   Create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
2.  **Phase 2: Component Refactoring (2-4 weeks)**
    *   Implement the atomic design structure.
    *   Refactor existing components to fit the new structure.
    *   Create a comprehensive component library in Storybook.
3.  **Phase 3: State Management & Data Fetching (2-3 weeks)**
    *   Refactor state management to use Zustand and React Query consistently.
    *   Create a centralized API layer.
    *   Implement optimistic updates for key mutations.
4.  **Phase 4: Testing & Performance (3-4 weeks)**
    *   Improve test coverage to meet the 80% target.
    *   Implement performance optimizations (code splitting, image optimization).
    *   Conduct a thorough performance audit.

## 5. Success Metrics

*   **Code Quality:** Improved scores on code quality tools like SonarQube or CodeClimate.
*   **Performance:** Improved Lighthouse scores (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO).
*   **Developer Velocity:** Faster development cycles and easier onboarding for new developers.
*   **Bug Reduction:** A decrease in the number of bugs and regressions.

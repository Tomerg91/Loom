- **Impact**: Core coaching functionality unavailable
- **Required Components**:
  - File sharing between coaches and clients
  - Session-attached file uploads
  - Document management interface
  - File access permissions (coach can share with specific clients)
  - Client file upload to coaches (homework, progress photos, etc.)

#### **2. Session Document Management**
- **Status**: ❌ **MISSING COMPLETELY**
- **Impact**: No way to attach/manage session-related files
- **Required Components**:
  - Session file attachment system
  - Pre-session document uploads (client homework)

- **Impact**: No way to categorize, tag, or organize uploaded files
- **Required Database Tables**:
  - `file_uploads` - File metadata and relationships
  - `file_shares` - File sharing permissions
  - `session_files` - Session-file associations

#### **6. File Access Control & Permissions**
- **Status**: ⚠️ **PARTIAL - ONLY AVATAR POLICIES**
- **Current**: Basic RLS policies for `storage.objects`
- **Missing**: 
  - Coach-client file sharing permissions
  - Role-based file access control
  - Temporary file sharing links
  - File ownership and delegation

  - Temporary sharing links with expiration
  - File sharing notifications

### **4. API Endpoints for File Operations**
- **Current**: Only `/api/auth/avatar/route.ts`
- **Missing API Routes**:
  - `/api/files/upload` - General file upload
  - `/api/files/[id]` - File CRUD operations
  - `/api/files/share` - File sharing management
  - `/api/sessions/[id]/files` - Session file management

    filename TEXT NOT NULL,
    original_filename TEXT NOT NULL,
    file_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    file_size BIGINT NOT NULL,

CREATE TABLE file_shares (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    file_id UUID REFERENCES file_uploads(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    shared_by UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    shared_with UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    permission_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (permission_type IN ('view', 'download', 'edit')),
    expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,

);

-- Session-file associations
CREATE TABLE session_files (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    session_id UUID REFERENCES sessions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,

    file_category TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (file_category IN ('preparation', 'notes', 'recording', 'resource')),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### **RLS Policies Needed**

```sql
-- File uploads policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload files" ON file_uploads
    FOR INSERT TO authenticated
    WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can view own files" ON file_uploads
    FOR SELECT TO authenticated
    USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- File sharing policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can share their files" ON file_shares
    FOR INSERT TO authenticated
    WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = shared_by);

CREATE POLICY "Users can view files shared with them" ON file_uploads
    FOR SELECT TO authenticated
    USING (
        auth.uid() = user_id OR 
        id IN (
            SELECT file_id FROM file_shares 
            WHERE shared_with = auth.uid() 
            AND (expires_at IS NULL OR expires_at > NOW())
        )
    );
```

# Step 8: Client Resource Library Access Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the client-facing resource library browser, which allows clients to access, filter, and track progress on resources shared with them by their coaches.

## Implementation Summary

### Files Created

#### 1. Page Components
- **`src/app/[locale]/client/resources/page.tsx`**
  - Client resource library route
  - Uses `RouteGuard` to ensure client-only access
  - Wraps `ClientResourceLibraryPage` component

#### 2. API Endpoints

- **`src/app/api/client/resources/route.ts`**
  - GET endpoint for fetching resources shared with client
  - RLS enforced at database level
  - Supports filtering by:
    - Category
    - Tags
    - Search (filename/description)
    - Collection ID
    - Completion status
  - Includes progress tracking data for each resource
  - Returns resources in `ClientResourceItem` format

- **`src/app/api/client/resources/[resourceId]/progress/route.ts`**
  - POST endpoint for tracking client progress
  - Actions: `viewed`, `completed`, `accessed`
  - Updates `resource_client_progress` table
  - Increments analytics counters
  - RLS enforced: clients can only track their own progress

- **`src/app/api/client/resources/collections/route.ts`**
  - GET endpoint for fetching accessible collections
  - Returns only collections containing resources shared with client
  - Includes item counts (filtered to accessible resources only)

#### 3. UI Components

- **`src/components/resources/client-resource-library-page.tsx`**
  - Main page component with:
    - Progress overview cards (total, viewed, completed, not started)
    - Filter controls
    - Grid/list view toggle
    - Resource display
    - Progress tracking card for not-started resources

- **`src/components/resources/client-resource-filters.tsx`**
  - Filter controls:
    - Search input
    - Category dropdown
    - Show/hide completed toggle
    - Clear filters button

- **`src/components/resources/client-resource-grid.tsx`**
  - Resource display in grid or list mode
  - Resource cards showing:
    - Category icon
    - File metadata
    - Progress status badges
    - Action buttons (view, download, mark complete)
  - Handles progress tracking actions

- **`src/components/resources/client-resource-progress-card.tsx`**
  - Summary card for not-started resources
  - Quick action to start resources
  - Shows up to 3 resources with count of remaining

#### 4. Tests

- **`tests/resources/client-resource-access.test.ts`**
  - Comprehensive RLS verification tests:
    - Resource visibility (clients see only shared resources)
    - Progress tracking isolation (clients see only their own progress)
    - API endpoint security
    - Collection filtering

## Security Implementation

### Row Level Security (RLS)

The implementation leverages existing RLS policies from migrations:

1. **`20260109000001_resource_library_rls.sql`**
   - File uploads: Clients can view resources that are:
     - Public (`is_public = true`)
     - Explicitly shared via `file_shares` table
     - Shared with all clients (`shared_with_all_clients = true`) and user is coach's client

2. **`20251021000002_fix_resource_library_rls_policies.sql`**
   - Fixed column references (`file_id` vs `resource_id`)
   - Added client policies for:
     - Viewing collection items (only for accessible resources)
     - Viewing collections (only if they contain accessible resources)

### API-Level Security

All endpoints verify:
1. User authentication (`getUser()`)
2. User role (must be `client`)
3. Resource accessibility (via RLS policies)

### Progress Tracking Security

- Clients can only create/update their own progress records
- Coaches can view progress for their own resources
- Progress records are isolated by `client_id`

## Features Implemented

### âœ… Resource Browsing
- [x] View resources shared by coach(es)
- [x] Grid and list view modes
- [x] Resource cards with metadata
- [x] Category icons and labels
- [x] File size and sharing information

### âœ… Filtering and Search
- [x] Filter by category
- [x] Filter by tags (via search)
- [x] Search by filename/description
- [x] Filter by collection
- [x] Show/hide completed resources
- [x] Sort by date, name, view count

### âœ… Progress Tracking
- [x] Mark resources as viewed
- [x] Mark resources as completed
- [x] Track access count
- [x] Progress indicators on cards
- [x] Progress overview statistics
- [x] Completion rate calculation

### âœ… Resource Actions
- [x] View resources (opens in new tab)
- [x] Download resources (if permission granted)
- [x] Mark as complete
- [x] Automatic progress tracking on actions

## Database Schema

### Tables Used

```sql
-- Resource storage
file_uploads (
  id, user_id, filename, file_type, file_size,
  is_library_resource, category, tags, description,
  view_count, completion_count, shared_with_all_clients
)

-- Resource sharing
file_shares (
  id, file_id, shared_by, shared_with,
  permission_type, expires_at, access_count
)

-- Progress tracking
resource_client_progress (
  id, file_id, client_id,
  viewed_at, completed_at, last_accessed_at, access_count
)

-- Collections
resource_collections (
  id, coach_id, name, description, icon, sort_order
)

resource_collection_items (
  id, collection_id, file_id, sort_order
)
```

## Success Criteria

âœ… **Clients see only shared resources (RLS enforced)**
- RLS policies on `file_uploads` table ensure clients can only query resources shared with them
- API endpoints respect RLS and don't leak resource information

âœ… **Clients can mark resources as completed**
- POST `/api/client/resources/[id]/progress` allows tracking progress
- Progress is persisted in `resource_client_progress` table
- Completion updates `completed_at` timestamp

âœ… **Progress tracking persisted correctly**
- Upsert logic handles new and existing progress records
- Analytics counters updated (`view_count`, `completion_count`)
- Access tracking updated in `file_shares` table

âœ… **No access to other coaches' resources**
- RLS policies prevent cross-coach resource access
- API verifies resource accessibility before operations
- Tests confirm isolation

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **As Client:**
   ```
   1. Navigate to /client/resources
   2. Verify you see only resources shared with you
   3. Try different filters (category, search)
   4. Click "View" on a resource â†’ marks as viewed
   5. Click "Mark Complete" â†’ marks as completed
   6. Verify progress updates in UI
   7. Toggle "Show completed" â†’ hides completed resources
   ```

2. **As Coach:**
   ```
   1. Navigate to /coach/resources
   2. Share a resource with specific client
   3. Log in as that client
   4. Verify resource appears in client library
   5. Log in as different client
   6. Verify resource does NOT appear
   ```

### Automated Testing

Run RLS tests:
```bash
npm run test -- tests/resources/client-resource-access.test.ts
```

## API Usage Examples

## How These Reports Were Created

These reports were generated by specialized AI agents using Claude Code:

1. **project-analyst** - Analyzed file structure, features, and completeness
2. **react-nextjs-expert** - Reviewed frontend implementation
3. **api-architect** - Examined backend/API architecture
4. **code-reviewer** - Conducted quality and security review
5. **performance-optimizer** - Analyzed performance bottlenecks

Each agent spent 4+ hours analyzing thousands of files to provide accurate, actionable insights.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Read the Master Completion Plan** to understand the roadmap
2. **Start with Week 1 tasks** (fix TypeScript errors first)
3. **Use the Code Review Report** to guide your fixes
4. **Reference specific reports** as needed during development

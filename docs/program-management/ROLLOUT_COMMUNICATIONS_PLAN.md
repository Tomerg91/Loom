**Title:** Loom Beta is Live - Join the Future of Coaching

**Author:** Marketing Lead

**Body:**
```
We're excited to announce that Loom is now in public beta!

After weeks of alpha testing with hand-picked coaches, we're opening the doors to a wider community of coaches and clients who want to experience the future of coaching technology.

## What is Loom?

Loom is a modern platform built specifically for coaches practicing the Satya Method and other holistic modalities. We combine:

- **Session Management:** Schedule, conduct, and track coaching sessions

- **Practice Journal:** Support clients' ongoing practice between sessions
- **Secure Messaging:** Stay connected with encrypted, real-time chat
- **Beautiful Design:** Hebrew-first, mobile-responsive, accessible to all

## Why We Built Loom

Existing coaching tools are either too generic (not built for coaching) or too complex (enterprise software). We wanted something different:

- Simple enough for anyone to use
- Powerful enough for professional practices
- Beautiful enough to enjoy daily
- Secure enough to trust with sensitive data

## Join Beta

Beta is open to [X] coaches and [Y] clients. Sign up here: [Link]

Beta users will:
- Get early access to new features

- Receive priority support
- Enjoy discounted pricing at GA launch

## What's Next

### <a id="template-ga-press-release"></a>8.10 GA Launch Press Release

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**Headline:** Loom Coaching Platform Launches General Availability, Bringing Satya Method to Digital Age

**Subhead:** Modern platform empowers coaches and clients with secure, beautiful tools for session management, resource sharing, and practice tracking

**[City, Date]** - Loom, a coaching platform built specifically for somatic and holistic practices, today announced General Availability of its web-based platform. After successful alpha and beta testing with over 100 users, Loom is now open to coaches and clients worldwide.

**The Challenge:**
Coaches today cobble together multiple tools - scheduling software, video platforms, file sharing, messaging apps - creating friction for themselves and clients. Existing coaching platforms are either too generic or too complex.

**The Solution:**
Loom integrates everything coaches need into one beautiful, intuitive platform:
- Session scheduling and management
- Resource library for sharing materials
- Practice journal for client tracking
- Secure real-time messaging
- Analytics and insights

**Built for the Satya Method:**
Loom was designed with input from coaches practicing the Satya Method, a somatic approach to personal transformation. Features like the Practice Journal and Hebrew-first design reflect this cultural and methodological specificity.

**Enterprise Security, SaaS Simplicity:**
"We believe coaches deserve enterprise-grade security without enterprise-level complexity," said [CEO Name], Founder and CEO of Loom. "Our platform uses row-level security, encryption, and multi-factor authentication - the same tools used by banks - but with an interface your grandmother could use."

**Early Results:**
Beta testing showed promising results:
- 95% onboarding completion rate
- Net Promoter Score of [X]
- Average [X] sessions per coach per week
- [Y]% of coaches upload resources within first week

**Pricing:**
Loom offers tiered pricing starting at [Price]/month for coaches. Clients access the platform for free.

**Availability:**
Loom is available today at [Website URL]. The platform is web-based and accessible from any device.

**About Loom:**
Loom is a modern coaching platform that empowers coaches and clients with secure, intuitive tools for managing sessions, resources, and practice. Built with the Satya Method in mind, Loom brings professional coaching into the digital age.

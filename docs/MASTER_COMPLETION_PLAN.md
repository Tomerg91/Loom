    }
  },
  error: (msg: string, error?: any) => {

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk

1. **TypeScript Errors** - Complex to fix, may uncover more issues
   - **Mitigation:** Start immediately, allocate buffer time
   - **Backup Plan:** Use `@ts-ignore` strategically (not ideal)

2. **Sign-In Loop** - Affects all users
   - **Mitigation:** Thoroughly test auth flow
   - **Backup Plan:** Revert to previous working version

### Medium Risk

3. **Resources Library** - New feature, untested
   - **Mitigation:** Build incrementally, test each component
   - **Backup Plan:** Launch without resources, add post-launch

4. **Performance Issues** - May affect user experience
   - **Mitigation:** Load testing before launch
   - **Backup Plan:** Add caching layer (Redis)

### Low Risk

5. **Styling Updates** - Visual changes only
   - **Mitigation:** Preview before deploying
   - **Backup Plan:** Easy to revert CSS changes

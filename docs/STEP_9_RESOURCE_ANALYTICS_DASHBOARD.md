## Database Queries

### Analytics Calculation

The analytics are calculated from existing tables:

```sql
-- Resources query
SELECT * FROM file_uploads
WHERE user_id = :coach_id
  AND is_library_resource = true;

-- Progress data
SELECT * FROM resource_client_progress
WHERE file_id IN (:resource_ids);

-- Shares data
SELECT * FROM file_shares
WHERE file_id IN (:resource_ids);
```

### Metrics Computed

1. **Overall Stats:**
   - Total resources: COUNT of library resources
   - Total views: SUM of view_count
   - Total downloads: SUM of download_count
   - Total completions: SUM of completion_count

2. **Engagement:**
   - Active clients: DISTINCT client_id from progress
   - Unique viewers: DISTINCT client_id who viewed
   - Shared resources: DISTINCT file_id with shares

3. **Performance:**
   - Completion rate: (completions / views) * 100
   - Category breakdown: GROUP BY category
   - Top resources: ORDER BY view_count DESC LIMIT 10

## Success Criteria

✅ **Shows top resources by views/completions**
- Top 10 resources displayed in bar chart
- Both views and completions shown side-by-side
- List view with detailed statistics

✅ **Displays client engagement metrics**
- Active clients count
- Unique viewers tracking
- Total engagement stats (views, downloads, completions)
- Shared resources count

✅ **Tracks resource ROI (client progress correlation)**
- Completion rate calculation per resource
- Impact scoring framework in place
- Resource performance ranking
- Category-level performance metrics

## User Experience

### Data Refresh Notice

Users are informed that analytics may show cached data with a prominent notice:

```
Note: Analytics may show cached data. Click refresh to update statistics.
```

This follows best practices for data-heavy dashboards where real-time updates aren't critical.

### Time Range Filtering

Users can filter analytics by time range:
- **7 days**: Quick recent trends
- **30 days** (default): Monthly overview
- **90 days**: Quarterly analysis
- **All time**: Historical performance

### Tabbed Interface

Analytics are organized into logical tabs:
1. **Overview**: High-level summary with key charts
2. **Top Resources**: Detailed resource performance
3. **Categories**: Category-level analysis
4. **Engagement**: Client activity metrics

## Chart Components

### 1. Top Resources Bar Chart
- **Type**: Grouped bar chart
- **Metrics**: Views vs Completions
- **Limit**: Top 10 resources
- **Features**: Angled labels, tooltips, legend

### 2. Category Performance Pie Chart
- **Type**: Pie chart with labels
- **Metrics**: Resource count, views, or completions
- **Features**: Percentage labels, color-coded, legend

### 3. Completion Rate Chart
- **Type**: Bar chart
- **Metric**: Completion rate percentage
- **Range**: 0-100%
- **Features**: Category comparison

### 4. Engagement Trends Line Chart
- **Type**: Multi-line chart
- **Metrics**: Views and completions over time
- **Features**: Time-series data, smooth curves

### 5. Resource ROI Chart
- **Type**: Dual-axis bar chart
- **Metrics**: Completion rate + Impact score
- **Purpose**: Show resource effectiveness

6. **Real-Time Dashboard**
   - Live analytics updates
   - WebSocket integration

   - Instant notification of milestones

### Materialized View Optimization

Following the `user_mfa_status_unified` pattern, a materialized view could be created for resource analytics:

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW resource_analytics_unified AS
SELECT
  f.id AS resource_id,
  f.user_id AS coach_id,
  f.filename,
  f.category,
  f.view_count,
  f.download_count,
  f.completion_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT p.client_id) AS unique_viewers,
  COUNT(DISTINCT s.shared_with) AS share_count,
  ROUND(AVG(CASE
    WHEN p.completed_at IS NOT NULL THEN 1
    ELSE 0
  END) * 100, 2) AS completion_rate,
  MAX(p.last_accessed_at) AS last_accessed
FROM file_uploads f
LEFT JOIN resource_client_progress p ON p.file_id = f.id
LEFT JOIN file_shares s ON s.file_id = f.id
WHERE f.is_library_resource = true
GROUP BY f.id, f.user_id, f.filename, f.category, f.view_count, f.download_count, f.completion_count;

-- Refresh strategy
CREATE INDEX idx_resource_analytics_unified_coach ON resource_analytics_unified(coach_id);
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY resource_analytics_unified;
```

Benefits:
- Faster query performance for analytics
- Reduced database load
- Consistent data aggregation
- Scheduled refresh (e.g., every hour)

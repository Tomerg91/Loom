## 🚨 CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES (P0 - PRODUCTION BLOCKERS)

### 1. MFA Service Backdoor Vulnerability ✅ FIXED
- **File**: `src/lib/services/mfa-service.ts`
- **Issue**: ~~Hardcoded test secrets allowing complete MFA bypass~~
- **Risk**: ~~Complete authentication system compromise~~
- **Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Removed hardcoded fallbacks, added production environment validation, implemented AES-256-GCM encryption for secrets
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Time Taken**: 2 hours
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed insecure 'build-time-fallback' keys
  - Added strict production environment validation 
  - Implemented encrypted storage for MFA secrets in database
  - Added proper key length validation (minimum 32 characters)

### 2. API Rate Limiting Gaps ✅ FIXED
- **Files**: `src/app/api/auth/mfa/verify-backup/route.ts`
- **Issue**: ~~Missing rate limiting on critical backup code verification endpoint~~
- **Risk**: ~~DDoS attacks and brute force attempts against backup codes~~
- **Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Added strict rate limiting (5 attempts/minute, 30min block)
- **Dependencies**: Rate limiting middleware implementation
- **Time Taken**: 1 hour
- **Solution**:
  - Added rate limiting to backup code verification (5 attempts/minute)
  - Added rate limiting to backup code status check (15 requests/minute)
  - Implemented IP-based tracking with 30-minute block duration
  - Added suspicious activity detection

### 3. CORS Misconfiguration ✅ VERIFIED SECURE
- **File**: `src/lib/security/cors.ts`, `next.config.js`
- **Issue**: ~~Wildcard origins allowed in production~~
- **Risk**: ~~Cross-origin attacks and data theft~~
- **Status**: ✅ **VERIFIED SECURE** - Proper CORS implementation found
- **Dependencies**: Environment-specific CORS configuration
- **Time Taken**: 0.5 hours
- **Finding**: 
  - CORS is properly configured with explicit origin allowlist
  - No wildcard (*) origins used in production
  - Credentials only allowed for verified origins
  - Proper fallback handling for unallowed origins
